			<ol>
				<li>Enter the classes that you will be taking. E.g. <span>CSCI-201</span>, <span>CTAN-450C</span>.</li>
				<li>Browse different schedules on the right. Use arrow keys <span>&uarr;</span> and <span>&darr;</span>.</li>
				<li className={classnames({disabled: !paid})}>Enable/disable classes by clicking them on the left.</li>
				<li className={classnames({disabled: !paid})}>Click and drag from anywhere on the calendar to <span>block</span> off that time. Click the blocks to remove them.</li>
				<li className={classnames({disabled: !paid})}>Click the sections you will definitely take to <span>anchor</span> them. The <span>red</span> border tells you they're anchored.</li>
				<li>Export your schedule and enjoy the hours you've saved!</li>
